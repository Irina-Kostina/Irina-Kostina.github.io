    <h1>This blog post is a reflection on my core personal Learning Plan.</h1>
    <div>
      <h3><strong>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</strong></h3>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to transition into a career in software
        development, find a great job and find the area in software development
        that suits me best. Possibly mobile app development or backend work. I
        want to become a skilled and reliable specialist in this field, ideally
        working in FinTech industry, because I have experience in finance and
        accounting. I’m aiming for a role that allows remote or flexible work so
        I can have a better balance in life.<br />
        <br />Personally, I’d love to buy a house somewhere up north from
        Auckland, get a dog, work remotely, and have the freedom to travel more
        often.

          >A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning</strong
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Strengths:</strong><br />
        <br />— Self-disciplined and well-organised when working in a
        comfortable environment<br />
        — Curious and committed to lifelong learning<br />
        — Able to learn independently, seek out resources when stuck, and ask
        questions when needed<br />
        — Reflective and open to feedback<br />
        <br />
        <br /><strong>Limitations:</strong><br />
        <br />— Can feel overwhelmed when under pressure or when unclear about
        expectations or instructions<br />
        — Struggle with self-confidence when comparing myself to others<br />
        — I’m easily distracted in noisy or unstructured environments. I learn
        best in calm, quiet settings and may lose focus in loud surroundings I'm
        afraid and overwhelmed by thoughts of making a mistake by giving up my
        current career for something unknown, though I find it interesting

        Non-technical skills I want to develop during my time at Dev Academy
      </h3>
      <p>
        While at Dev Academy, I would like to develop these crucial for
        developer human skills:<br />
        <strong>1. Communications.</strong><br />
        I want to improve my ability to communicate with people who have
        different mindsets. It’s important to me to learn how to adapt to
        different communication styles while still staying myself. I also
        believe that effective, respectful communication is essential for any
        team to work well together.<br />
        <strong>2. Prioritising.</strong><br />
        When there’s a lot to do, I can get overwhelmed and not know where to
        start. I want to learn how to focus on the most important tasks first
        and prioritise tasks.<br />
        <strong>3. Creativity.</strong><br />
        I’d like to develop my creative thinking. Problem-solving in tech is
        often about finding new ways to approach old problems, and I want to
        train myself to think outside the box and not be afraid of trying
        something unusual.

      <h3>My commitment to managing workload during The programme</h3>
      <p>
        I commit to managing my workload by staying organised, setting clear
        daily and weekly goals, and breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable
        steps. I’ll use tools like Toggle, to-do lists, or task boards to stay
        on track. I’ll also make sure to take regular breaks and maintain
        healthy boundaries to prevent burnout. <br /><br />To work productively
        and safely with others, I’ll communicate openly and respectfully, listen
        actively, and be mindful of different mindsets and working styles. I’ll
        aim to contribute equally in group tasks and stay accountable for my
        part. <br /><br />When I start to feel overwhelmed or notice stress
        building up, I’ll pause, take a short break, and reassess my priorities.
        I’ll ask for support if I need it and try to identify what exactly is
        causing the pressure. I’ll do my best to avoid burnout and keep learning
        effectively

      <h3>My commitment to seeking help promptly and effectively</h3>
      <p>
        If I feel stuck or unsure about something, I commit to seeking help
        within 20–30 minutes rather than losing too much time trying to figure
        it out alone. I’ll first try to find answers by checking course
        resources, documentation, or my notes. If that doesn’t help, I’ll go and
        Google my questions and try to find answers online. And if that doesn’t
        help as well, I’ll reach out through the appropriate channels on Discord
        or ask a facilitator directly. I understand that seeking help is part of
        the learning process and not a weakness, and I’ll make an effort to be
        proactive and clear when looking for support.
