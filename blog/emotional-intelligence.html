    <h1><strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong></h1>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is all about understanding emotions. Our own
      and other people’s. It means you can notice how you're feeling, manage
      those feelings, and respond to others in a thoughtful way. People with
      good emotional intelligence are usually good at staying calm under
      pressure, handling stress, listening to others, and getting along with
      different types of people. It’s not about being emotional. It’s about
      being smart with emotions. In everyday life, EQ helps to avoid saying
      things you’ll regret, solve problems without drama, and build better
      relationships with friends, family, or coworkers.
    </p>
    <h1><strong>How is EQ different to IQ?</strong></h1>
    <p>
      EQ (Emotional Intelligence) and IQ (Intelligence Quotient) are two
      different ways of being intelligent. IQ is about how well you think. It
      includes things like logic, problem-solving, memory, and learning. It’s
      often measured through tests and is linked to school and academic success.
      EQ is about how well you handle emotions—your own and other people’s. It’s
      more about how you communicate, deal with stress, show empathy, and work
      with others.
    </p>
    <h1><strong>Why is EQ important?</strong></h1>
    <p>
      EQ is important because it helps to handle everyday life better. It’s what
      helps to stay calm during stress, talk things through instead of arguing,
      and understand how others feel. People with strong EQ usually build better
      relationships, work well in teams, and make more thoughtful decisions. In
      work and in life, emotions come up all the time. EQ gives you the tools to
      respond wisely instead of reacting quickly.
