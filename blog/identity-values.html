        <h1>The aim of this blog post is to reflect on my core personal values, and my strengths and limitations.</h1>
        <div>
            <h3><strong>A situation where I have made an ethical decision.</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Situation.</strong> While working as an accountant assistant, I once noticed a small but consistent discrepancy in how client reimbursements were recorded.<br>
<strong>Ethical Dilemma.</strong> I realised that bringing this up might create tension with a senior staff member who handled those entries. The conflict was between protecting harmony in the team and maintaining financial integrity and transparency.<br>
<strong>Decision.</strong> After considering both values, I decided to raise the concern quietly with my manager, focusing on the process rather than any individual. I framed it as a suggestion to improve accuracy rather than an accusation.<br>
<strong>Outcome.</strong> The manager appreciated my approach. It turned out to be a clerical error, and the process was improved without any conflict.<br>
<strong>Reflection.</strong> I still feel I made the right choice. I realised that honesty and responsibility don’t have to come at the cost of relationships if handled with respect and care.

            <h3><strong>Next, I'd like to describe how my culture and the people around me have influenced my values and identity.</strong></h3>
            <p><strong>Kindness.</strong><br>
Growing up surrounded by people who deeply value kindness, I was strongly influenced by this and now consider it one of the most important values in today’s chaotic world. In my culture, kindness is often shown through actions like helping without being asked, sharing even when you have little, or simply being there for someone. I’ve learned that real kindness is quiet, sincere, and deeply meaningful. It’s a value I try to reflect in how I treat others every. <br>
<strong>Work ethic from my family.</strong><br>
My parents always worked hard and stayed committed to their responsibilities. Watching them made me value discipline, perseverance, and doing my best even when things are hard.<br>
<strong>Honest and direct communication</strong><br>
Russian culture tends to value blunt honesty. People often say exactly what they mean, which I’ve come to appreciate. It taught me not to take things personally, but to focus on clear, open communication. This has helped me build stronger, more transparent relationships, both personally and professionally.<br>
<strong>Deep loyalty in close relationships</strong><br>
Although people may appear distant at first, once you build trust, Russian friendships and family bonds are incredibly strong. I’ve learned to invest in meaningful, long-term connections, and to be someone others can truly rely on. This sense of loyalty is a core part of my identity.

            <h3><strong>How my Strengths will support my learning journey.</strong></h3>
            <p>I believe my main strengths are self-discipline, curiosity, perseverance, open-mindedness, creativity, and the ability to learn independently. When I’m in a comfortable environment, I organise my time well and set clear goals. I’m naturally curious and enjoy understanding how things work, which keeps me motivated. I stay open to new perspectives and find it easy to generate fresh ideas or think outside the box. I don’t give up easily, even when something is difficult, I keep trying different approaches until I succeed. I’m also confident in using online resources and learning on my own. These strengths will support me by helping me adapt, stay engaged, and overcome challenges during my learning journey.

            <h3><strong>Reflecting on my Limitations and their impact on my learning and career development</strong></h3>
            <p>One of my limitations is that when I face challenges, I sometimes feel demotivated and start questioning whether I made the right decision to pursue this learning path. This self-doubt can slow down my progress and make it harder to stay consistent.
Another challenge is fear of failure, especially when I step outside of a comfort zone. It can affect my confidence when dealing with new or complex tasks.
I also find it difficult to stay focused when I feel overwhelmed, particularly when I have a lot of tasks in my to-do-list. I always try to slow down for a moment and prioritise these tasks to get all things clear and structured in my head.</p>

            <h3><strong>Navigating team tension and learning better collaboration strategies.</strong></h3>
            <p>When I was working as an accountant, we had to implement a new system for tracking client payments. I was enthusiastic about the changes, but one of my colleagues was resistant. She preferred the old manual process and was hesitant to learn the new system.
I tried to stay calm and respectful to work productively. I offered to support her during the transition, explained how the new system would save our time and reduce errors, and even created a simple step-by-step guide to help her and we organised a meeting, where I showed the new system. While she appreciated the effort, she still remained distant and skeptical for a while.
In the end, the system was adopted, but the collaboration could have been smoother. Looking back, I realise that I focused more on the technical benefits rather than listening to their emotional concerns, like fear of making mistakes or losing control.
If I faced a similar situation now, I would start by asking more open questions to understand her hesitation and involve her more in the change process from the beginning. I believe this would make her feel more valued and reduce resistance.
