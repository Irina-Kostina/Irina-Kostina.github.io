    <h1>What's Neuroplasticity?</h1>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to change and adapt throughout life
      by forming new connections between neurons. It allows us to learn new
      skills, recover from injuries, and improve memory and thinking through
      practice and experience. This flexibility means the brain is constantly
      reshaping itself based on what we do, think, and feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding how neuroplasticity works helps people see that they can
      keep learning and improving at any age. It means the brain can change and
      grow when we practise something new or break old habits. Knowing the brain
      can adapt makes it easier to stay motivated, try new things, and not give
      up when something feels hard at first. This gives people hope. Whether
      they’re trying to learn a language, recover after an injury, or deal with
      stress or anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will engage with the principles of neuroplasticity by challenging myself
      to learn new things regularly, like a language, a creative skill or
      studying this course. I would try to repeat and practise often, because
      the brain gets stronger at things we do regularly. I’d also pay attention
      to my mindset by staying positive and open to change, because the way I
      think can shape my brain too. Most importantly, I’d remind myself that
      mistakes and setbacks are part of learning, and that with effort and time,
      my brain can keep growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can increase my neuroplasticity by keeping my brain active and open to
      new challenges, like studying programming languages and doing this course.
      Learning new things helps my brain form fresh connections. I’ll try to
      stay consistent with my study routine, get enough sleep, and take breaks
      to refresh my mind. I also like to mix up how I learn by watching videos,
      taking notes, or discussing ideas to keep my brain engaged in different
      ways.

    <h1>What's Growth Mindset</h1>
    <p>
      A growth mindset means believing that you can get better at something
      through effort, practice, and learning. Instead of thinking you're just
      "not good" at something, you see challenges as chances to grow. This way
      of thinking is important because it helps you stay motivated, bounce back
      from setbacks, and keep improving. Whether you're learning a new skill or
      facing a tough situation, having a growth mindset makes it easier to keep
      going and reach your goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      What surprised me in this exploration was how much our mindset can affect
      what we achieve. I used to think that some people were just naturally good
      at things, but learning about the growth mindset showed me that effort and
      attitude play a big role.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ll use a growth mindset by staying open to challenges and not getting
      discouraged by mistakes. Instead of avoiding things I find difficult, I’ll
      see them as chances to improve. I’ll keep putting in effort, ask questions
      when I need help, and remind myself that learning is a process that takes
      time and practice.
